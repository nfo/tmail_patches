This Ruby files patch some methods of TMail 1.2.3.1.
I did not make a proper fork because TMail is not actively maintained anymore.

Mikel Lindsaar, the project admin of TMail on RubyForge, now works on a very promising rewrite for Ruby 1.9.1, named Mail http://github.com/mikel/mail.

I use rchardet http://rubyforge.org/projects/rchardet/ for encoding detection.

To remove the dependency to activesupport, just replace 'alias_method_chain' calls by simple 'alias' calls.
