This Ruby files patch some methods of TMail 1.2.3.1.
I did not make a proper fork because TMail is not actively maintained anymore.

Mikel Lindsaar, the project admin of TMail on RubyForge, now works on a very promising rewrite for Ruby 1.9.1, named Mail http://github.com/mikel/mail.

Also, I won't commit any unit tests. The tests I coded are too linked to the project I'm working on.
But I can ensure you that these patches get the job done :)
